       <p>By the research of national geography, it is said to be living in the dense forest of Kailasa. it is a 100% vegan whose diet filled with plums that grows on the forest trees. it is not migratory. and its endagered. Scientists named it as Blue-red robin. By census, it came to know very few, one in thousand, saw this bird. They are of family <i>Genissa pectaetra</i>. Historic people hunted it for the high uranium content in it. its feather are helpful to cure cosorona mythelis, caused by a virus. so the people started hunting it, and lowered their population. And the bird flu that broke out on Kailasa was also a major cause of death of these beautiful creatures.</p>
